# Title: Clorth: a Forth in Clojure

## Abstract

Forth is a stack-oriented programming language with almost no grammar. It builds complexity from a set of definitions called "words" and this minimalism has found niche applications in many embedded systems. Forth is the perfect environment to learn how to implement your own domain specific language for fun and profit: we'll see why Clojure makes this such an enjoyable experience.
